/// Calculate the kinetic energy required to jump to a certain height when different gravity is
/// applied in different segments of the jump.
///
/// **MOTIVATION**: Ballistically accurate jumps where the gravity is constant don't feel good in
/// games. To improve the player experience, Tnua applies higher gravity in different segments of
/// the jump (e.g. to get faster takeoff or to reduce the airtime at the tip of the jump). Being
/// able to control the height of the jump is still vital though, and needs to be done by setting
/// the initial upward velocity of the jump. `SegmentedJumpInitialVelocityCalculator` is a tool for
/// calculating the latter from the former.
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy_tnua::util::SegmentedJumpInitialVelocityCalculator;
/// # use bevy_tnua::math::Float;
/// # let jump_height = 2.0;
/// # const GRAVITY: Float = 9.81;
/// let takeoff_upward_velocity = SegmentedJumpInitialVelocityCalculator::new(jump_height)
///     // When upward velocity is below 1.0, use an extra gravity of 20.0
///     .add_segment(GRAVITY + 20.0, 1.0)
///     // When upward velocity is between 1.0 and 2.0, use regular gravity
///     .add_segment(GRAVITY, 2.0)
///     // When upward velocity is higher than 2.0, use an extra gravity of 30.0
///     .add_final_segment(GRAVITY + 30.0)
///     // After adding all the segments, get the velocity required to make such a jump
///     .required_initial_velocity()
///     .expect("`add_final_segment` should have covered remaining height");
/// ```
///
/// Note that:
///
/// * Only the part of the jump where the character goes up is relevant here. The part after the
///   peak where the character goes down may have its own varying gravity, but since that gravity
///   can not affect the height of the jump `SegmentedJumpInitialVelocityCalculator` does not need
///   to care about it.
/// * Segments are calculated from top to bottom. The very top - the peak of the jump - has, by
///   definition, zero upward velocity, so the `velocity_threshold` passed to it is the one at the
///   bottom. The last segment should have `INFINITY` as its velocity.
/// * The internal representation and calculation is with kinetic energy for a rigid body with a
///   mass of 1.0 rather than with velocities.
