/// Utility for deciding which animation to play.

/// Add `TnuaAnimatingState<State>` as a component, where `State` is a data type - usually an
/// `enum` - that determines which animation to play. Each frame, decide (with the help of
/// [`TnuaController`](crate::prelude::TnuaController)) which animation should
/// be played and the animation's parameters (like speed) and feed it to the `TnuaAnimatingState`.
/// Use the emitted [`TnuaAnimatingStateDirective`] to determine if this is a new animation or an
/// existing one (possibly with different parameters), and use that information to work the actual
/// animation player.
