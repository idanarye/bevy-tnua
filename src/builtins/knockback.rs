/// parameters are seriously skewed. The main parameters that can mess it up and unreasonably
/// prolong the knockback duration are:
/// * [`no_push_timer`](Self::no_push_timeout). Setting it too high will allow the character to
///   "move along" with the shove, prolonging the knockback action because the boundary does not
///   get cleared. The action will not affect the velocity during that time, but it can still
///   prolong the animation, apply [`force_forward`](Self::force_forward), and prevent other
///   actions from happening.
/// * [`barrier_strength_diminishing`](Self::barrier_strength_diminishing). Setting it too low
///   makes it very hard for the character to push through the boundary. It starts getting slightly
///   weird below 1.0, and really weird below 0.5. Better keep it at above - 1.0 levels.
